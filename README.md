# Curatarr

**Personalized recommendations for your Plex library. Simple setup. Powerful results.**

Turn your Plex server into a smart recommendation engine. Analyze what you and your users watch, then surface the hidden gems already in your library—plus discover what to add next.

---

## Why This Exists

Your Plex library has thousands of titles. Your users have watched maybe 10% of them. The problem isn't content—it's discovery.

**Curatarr solves this by:**
- Analyzing each user's watch history
- Scoring unwatched content by similarity (keywords, genres, cast, directors)
- Creating personalized collections that update automatically
- Generating external watchlists so you know what to acquire next

---

## Features

### For Your Library (What to Watch)
- **Per-user recommendations** — Each user gets their own curated collection
- **Private by default** — Users only see their own recommendations, not others'
- **Smart scoring** — Weights keywords, genres, cast, and directors
- **Recency bias** — Recent watches influence recommendations more
- **Rewatch detection** — Content you love gets weighted higher
- **Genre exclusions** — Skip horror for the kids, documentaries for movie night
- **Auto-updating collections** — `🎬 John - Recommendations` appears in Plex

### For Acquisition (What to Get)
- **External watchlists** — Content NOT in your library that users would love
- **Sequel Huntarr** — Find missing movies from collections you've started (complete that trilogy!)
- **Horizon Huntarr** — Track upcoming unreleased movies from franchises you own
- **Streaming service grouping** — "Available on Netflix" vs "Need to acquire"
- **Sonarr/Radarr integration** — Push recommendations directly for download
- **Trakt/Simkl/MDBList export** — Sync to tracking services and list managers
- **Auto-cleanup** — Items removed when they appear in your library
- **Genre balancing** — Matches user viewing habits proportionally

### For You (Simple & Robust)
- **One command** — `./run.sh` handles everything
- **Modular config** — Main settings plus optional integration files
- **Auto-updates** — Pulls latest code from GitHub on each run (optional)
- **Smart caching** — Auto-clears incompatible caches after updates
- **Auto-scheduling** — Optional daily cron job
- **Clean logs** — Know exactly what happened

---

## Quick Start

### macOS / Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
./run.sh    # Setup wizard runs on first launch
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
.\run.ps1   # Setup wizard runs on first launch
```

### Docker (Local Build)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
./setup.sh              # Interactive setup wizard (recommended)
docker compose up --build
```

Or manually configure:
```bash
cp config/config.example.yml config/config.yml
# Edit config/config.yml with your details
docker compose up --build
```

### Docker (GHCR Image)

Published image:
```text
ghcr.io/samrenfrew/curatarr
```

Use the included compose example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OrchestratedChaos/curatarr.git
cd curatarr
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up
```

Optional `.env` example (for compose variable substitution):
```bash
CURATARR_TAG=latest
TZ=America/New_York
PLEX_URL=http://your-plex-server:32400
PLEX_TOKEN=YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN
TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
```

First run takes 5-10 minutes to analyze your library. After that, it's fast.

---

## What You Get

### In Plex
Collections automatically appear:
```
🎬 John - Recommendations       (50 movies)
🎬 Sarah - Recommendations      (50 movies)
📺 John - Recommendations       (20 shows)
📺 Sarah - Recommendations      (20 shows)
```

Pin them to your home screen. They update daily.

### External Watchlists
Interactive HTML file with export buttons:
```
recommendations/external/watchlist.html

- All users combined in one interface
- Select which movies/shows to export
- Click "Export to Radarr/Sonarr" → downloads IMDB IDs
- Grouped by streaming service availability
- Auto-opens in browser after run (configurable)
```

Also generates per-user markdown for reference:
```
recommendations/external/john_watchlist.md
recommendations/external/sarah_watchlist.md
```

---

## Configuration

### Minimal Config
```yaml
plex:
  url: http://your-plex-server:32400
  token: YOUR_PLEX_TOKEN
  movie_library: Movies
  tv_library: TV Shows

tmdb:
  api_key: YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY

users:
  list: john, sarah, kids
```

**Get your keys:**
- [TMDB API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (free account required)
- [Plex Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)

### Environment Variables

For Docker or CI environments, you can use environment variables instead of storing tokens in config.yml:

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `PLEX_URL` | `plex.url` |
| `PLEX_TOKEN` | `plex.token` |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | `tmdb.api_key` |

Environment variables take precedence over config file values.

For `docker-compose.ghcr.yml`, these compose variables are also supported:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CURATARR_TAG` | Image tag (for example `latest` or `v2.8.19`) |
| `TZ` | Container timezone (for example `America/New_York`) |

### Per-User Preferences
```yaml
users:
  list: john, sarah, kids
  preferences:
    john:
      display_name: John
      streaming_services: [netflix, hulu, disney_plus]
    sarah:
      display_name: Sarah
      exclude_genres: [horror]
    kids:
      display_name: Kids
      exclude_genres: [horror, thriller, war]
      max_rating: PG  # Only G and PG content (movies: G < PG < PG-13 < R < NC-17)
```

**Content Rating Filter:**
- Movies: `G`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `R`, `NC-17` (from least to most restrictive)
- TV: `TV-Y`, `TV-Y7`, `TV-G`, `TV-PG`, `TV-14`, `TV-MA` (from least to most restrictive)
- Recommendations above the user's `max_rating` are filtered out

### General Settings
```yaml

tag: Curatarr               # Tag for easy cleanup

# Safe defaults (shows just get added, no downloads)
monitor: false              # Don't monitor for new episodes
search_missing: false       # Don't search for episodes
```

**Setup:** Run `./run.sh` and follow Step 7, or manually create `config/sonarr.yml`.

**User modes:**
- `mapping` — Only sync users listed in `plex_users`
- `per_user` — Sync all users separately
- `combined` — Merge everyone's recommendations

### Radarr Integration (Optional)

export:
  enabled: true
  auto_sync: true
  user_mode: mapping
  plex_users: [your_username]
```

**Setup:** Run `./run.sh` and follow Step 10, or manually create `config/simkl.yml`.

### Huntarr: Collection Movie Finder

Huntarr scans your Plex library for movies that belong to collections (trilogies, franchises, etc.) and helps you track what's missing and what's coming.

```yaml
# In config/config.yml
huntarr:
  sequel_huntarr: true    # Find missing movies from collections you've started
  horizon_huntarr: true   # Track upcoming unreleased movies from collections you own
```

**Sequel Huntarr** — Missing collection movies:
- Scans all movies in your library for TMDB collection IDs
- Shows collection name and how many you own (e.g., "2/3")
- Displays streaming availability for missing movies
- Only includes released movies (no placeholders)

**Horizon Huntarr** — Upcoming releases:
- Finds unreleased movies from franchises you own
- Shows production status (Post Production, In Production, Planned, Rumored)
- Displays expected release date (or TBA)
- Perfect for tracking that next Marvel or Star Wars film

**Both features appear as separate tabs in the HTML watchlist, centered below user tabs.**

**Command-line flag:**
- `--huntarr-only` — Run only Huntarr features, skip recommendations (`./run.sh --huntarr-only`)

**Caching:** Collection data cached for 7 days. IMDB IDs cached permanently. Cache auto-invalidates when your library changes.

### External Recommendations: Relevance Score

The `min_relevance_score` setting (0.0-1.0) controls how strictly personal the external watchlist recommendations are:

- **Score** = How many of your watched items recommend this title (normalized 0-100%)
- **Rating** = TMDB audience rating (used only as tiebreaker)

**How it works:**
1. Items above the threshold are prioritized (sorted by personal relevance)
2. Lower-scored items only appear if not enough high-relevance items exist
3. This ensures you get personally relevant content, not just popular movies

**Tuning:**
- `0.25` (default) — Balanced. Most users should start here.
- `0.50` — Stricter. Only highly relevant recommendations.
- `0.10` — Looser. More variety, but less personalized.

If you're seeing too many "random" recommendations, increase this value.

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetch watch history** — Pulls each user's watched content from Plex
2. **Build preference profile** — Counts genres, directors, actors, keywords watched
3. **Score unwatched content** — Calculates similarity to user's taste
4. **Apply filters** — Excludes genres, enforces quality thresholds
5. **Create collections** — Labels content in Plex, collections auto-populate
6. **Generate watchlists** — External recommendations grouped by streaming service

### Similarity Scoring
```
Score = (keyword_match × 0.50) +    # Most specific signal - themes, topics
        (genre_match × 0.25) +       # Baseline preference
        (actor_match × 0.20) +       # Cast preferences
        (director_match × 0.05)      # Style indicator (most don't pick by director)
```

**Scoring uses sum with diminishing returns** — Multiple weak matches add up rather than averaging down. A movie with 15 matching keywords scores well even if each individual match is partial.

Weighted by recency (recent watches count more), user ratings (5-star content counts more), and rewatch count (loved content counts more).

**Weight redistribution:** If a movie's component has no matches (e.g., unknown director), that weight redistributes proportionally to components that did match—so you still get meaningful scores.

## Scheduling

First run prompts for automatic scheduling. Or add manually:

### macOS / Linux (cron)
```bash
# Daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/curatarr && ./run.sh >> logs/daily-run.log 2>&1
```

### Windows (Task Scheduler)
The PowerShell script offers to create a scheduled task automatically. Or manually:
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task → "Curatarr"
3. Trigger: Daily at 3:00 AM
4. Action: Start a program
   - Program: `powershell.exe`
   - Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\curatarr\run.ps1"`

### Docker (cron on host)
```bash
# Daily at 3 AM
0 3 * * * cd /path/to/curatarr && docker compose run --rm curatarr >> logs/daily-run.log 2>&1
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need Plex Pass?**
No. Works with free Plex.

**Q: Will this modify my media files?**
No. Only adds labels to Plex metadata.

**Q: How many watched items needed?**
At least 5 for meaningful recommendations.

**Q: Can users see each other's recommendations?**
No! By default, private collections are enabled—each user only sees their own recommendations, not other users'. The admin/server owner sees all (Plex limitation). Disable with `private_collections: false` in tuning.yml if you want shared visibility.

**Q: What about new users with no history?**
They're skipped until they have enough watch history.

---

## Troubleshooting

### macOS / Linux
```bash
# Check logs
tail -100 logs/daily-run.log

# Run with debug output
./run.sh --debug

# Verify config
python3 -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config/config.yml')))"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Check logs
Get-Content logs/daily-run.log -Tail 100

# Run with debug output
.\run.ps1 -Debug

# Verify config
python -c "import yaml; print(yaml.safe_load(open('config/config.yml')))"
```

**Common issues:**
- TMDB API key invalid → Get free key from themoviedb.org
- Plex connection failed → Check URL and token
- No recommendations → User needs more watch history
- "Cache outdated" message → Normal after updates, rebuilds automatically
- Want to disable auto-update → Set `general.auto_update: false` in config/config.yml

### Docker
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose build --no-cache

# Check container status
docker compose ps
```

**Docker-specific issues:**
- Connection refused to Plex → Use host IP (not `localhost`), try `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop
- Permission denied on cache/logs → Run `chmod -R 777 cache logs recommendations` on host

**Manual update (if auto-update disabled):**
```bash
git pull origin main
```
